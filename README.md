- **Formik & Yup**: Used for form handling and validation.
- **React Router**: For routing between different pages and components.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making API requests to the Laravel backend.
- **React-Query**: For handling data fetching and caching.
- **React-Redux/React-Slice**: State management for handling global state.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14.x or above)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **PHP** (for the Laravel API backend)
- **Composer** (for managing Laravel dependencies)
- **MySQL** (or any database supported by Laravel)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VikrantParmar/reactjs-authify-crudX.git
   cd reactjs-authify-crudX
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies: In the root of the project (frontend directory), run:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup Environment Variables:**  
   Create a .env file in the frontend directory and add the API URL.

4. **Run the development servers:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the Application Open your browser and navigate to**
   ```bash
   http://localhost:3001
   ```

### Description of Directories/Files:

- **`assets/`**: Contains static files such as images, fonts, and other resources used throughout the app.
- **`components/`**: Includes reusable UI components that are used across different pages and sections of the app.
- **`hooks/`**: Custom hooks are placed here. They encapsulate reusable logic, API calls, or any complex state management that can be shared between components.
- **`store/`**: Contains Redux slices and state management logic. The state is managed globally using `Redux Toolkit` and `React-Slice`.
- **`utils/`**: Utility functions that can be used across the application, such as formatting, validation, etc.
- **`pages/`**: Contains page-level components. These are typically used for routing purposes and represent different views of the application.
- **`App.jsx`**: The main component that sets up the application's layout, routes, and global context.
- **`main.jsx`**: The main entry point for the application. It initializes the app by rendering the `App` component and includes any necessary providers (like Redux or Router).
- **`index.html`**: The entry point for the React app, typically used for rendering the React app into the root DOM element (`index.html`).

---

This structure helps in maintaining clean, modular code by separating concerns based on the functionality of each part of the application. You can expand and add additional directories as the project grows.
